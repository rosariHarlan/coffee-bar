            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs after deciding to give up my 9 to 5
                job in the city. With no catering experience, the only way I knew how to operate a business was NOT to
                look at it as a business. I treated it like my home and all the customers were guests in my home.</p>
            <p>After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle as I have not yet learnt the art of the business
                but have mastered the art of being a host. We buy the best fresh ingredients and cook the food I serve
                to my
                family at home. Everything is freshly cooked on site and served immediately to our guests.</p>
